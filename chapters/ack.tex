I am grateful to my advisors, Francisco B. Pereira and Luís Paquete, who have supported me with their knowledge throughout this dissertation while allowing me the room to work in my own way.

I would like to express my regards to the ECOS (Evolutionary and Complex Systems) group for the contributions and opinions.

I would like to show my gratitude to my colleagues, particularly Diogo Machado, Fábio Pedrosa, Ivo Gonçalves and Marco Simões for all the time that we have spent together, and the constant encouragement.

To my family and friends.

To all people who contributed to my education.

My final words are addressed to my parents. Thank you for the support and encouragement. Without them I would not be who I am today and this work would not be possible.
